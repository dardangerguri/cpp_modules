# cpp_modules

A collection of modules that make up 42 school's C++ piscine. These modules gradually introduce students to concepts related to object-oriented programming, such as classes, inheritance, ad-hoc polymorphism, templates, containers, and more.

## Modules Overview

#### [CPP_Module 00](https://github.com/dardangerguri/cpp_modules/tree/master/cpp00)
> This module, helps learn the basics of C++ and Object-Oriented Programming. Topics include namespaces, classes, constructors, initialization lists, destructors, public and private member/non-member variables and functions, static variables, the const keyword, strings, iomanip, std streams, etc.

---

#### [CPP_Module 01](https://github.com/dardangerguri/cpp_modules/tree/master/cpp01)
 > This module covers memory allocation, pointers, references, input/output streams, and switch statements.

---

#### [CPP_Module 02](https://github.com/dardangerguri/cpp_modules/tree/master/cpp02)
> This module covers ad-hoc polymorphism, operator overloading, and the Orthodox Canonical class form.

---

#### [CPP_Module 03](https://github.com/dardangerguri/cpp_modules/tree/master/cpp03)
> This module covers issues related to class inheritance are covered in this module.

---

#### [CPP_Module 04](https://github.com/dardangerguri/cpp_modules/tree/master/cpp04)
> This module covers class inheritance, subtype polymorphism, abstract classes, and interfaces.

---

#### [CPP_Module 05](https://github.com/dardangerguri/cpp_modules/tree/master/cpp05)
> This module introduces exception classes, messages, and try/catch blocks.

---

#### [CPP_Module 06](https://github.com/dardangerguri/cpp_modules/tree/master/cpp06)
> This module introduces different C++ casts.

---

#### [CPP_Module 07](https://github.com/dardangerguri/cpp_modules/tree/master/cpp07)
> This module introduces C++ templates.

---

#### [CPP_Module 08](https://github.com/dardangerguri/cpp_modules/tree/master/cpp08)
> This module introduces templated containers, iterators, and algorithms.The use of STL and related algorithms is highly encouraged.

---

#### [CPP_Module 09](https://github.com/dardangerguri/cpp_modules/tree/master/cpp09)
> This module explores STL containers, iterators, and algorithms. The use of STL is mandatory, and each exercise requires the use of one or more container types, which cannot be reused for the following exercises in the module.
